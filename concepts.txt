for integer array{
inside main: max array size 10^6
global array: max size is 10^7 

and if you exceed this, then you will get segmentation fault.

if you declare an array globally, then everything is initialized to zero by default.
}

collision in hashing: whatever hashing you are using but if all the keys end up on the same hash index then it is called collision(worst case->O(N)).

in a map: any data structure can be a key.
in unordered_map: only have individual data type as a key(ex: pair, vector are not allowed)

time Complexity{
	unordered_map: avg and best-> O(1) , worst-> O(N).
}

->if you are accessing an index which is not present while looping, then it will throw runtime error.
